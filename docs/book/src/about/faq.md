## Where does the name "Elembic" come from?

Elembic's name comes from "element" + ["alembic"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alembic), to indicate that one of Elembic's goals is to experiment with different approaches for this functionality, and to help shape a future update to Typst that includes native custom elements, which will eventually remove the need for using this package.
